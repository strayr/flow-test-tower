## Results
The following are for guidance only
- Ankun PET-G at 235C
  - 0.6MM CHT: gaps appear in print at 22mm3/s, looks great up until that point
  - 0.4mm reprap/v6 gaps appear at 13mm3/s, starts looking stripey at around 11mm3/s
- Anycubic PLA at 210C
  - 0.6mm CHT: failures at 28mm3/s
  - 0.4mm reprap/v6: failures at 15mm3/s, prints well at 14mm3/s
  - 0.4mm E3D Revo Voron: failures at 15mm3/s, prints well at 14mm3/s
- eSun ABS+ at 255C
  - 0.6mm CHT: Completed 34mm3/s tower with no failures, currently doing much printing at 30mm/s without issue
  - 0.4mm reprap/v6: skipped extrusions at 18mm3/s, suspect it's good for 15mm3/s printing
